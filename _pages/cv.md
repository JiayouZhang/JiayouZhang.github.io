Research interests
======

Exploring machine learning methods for understanding protein structures and advancing biological AI models

- Structural Biology
- Biological Foundation Models

Education
======

* **B.S. in Computer Science and Technology**, Tsinghua University, 2022  (Beijing, China)
* **Ph.D. in Machine Learning**, MBZUAI, 2026 (expected)  (Abu Dhabi, UAE)
  * Focus: Protein structural prediction with machine learning

Work experience
======

* **Summer 2021: Research Assistant**  
  * Wang Lab ([Link](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/group.html))  
  * **Supervisor**: Shen Wang  
  * **Duties**: Processed biomedical text with language models; co-first authored "GraphPrompt: Graph-Based Prompt Templates for Biomedical Synonym Prediction," published at AAAI 2023.  

* **Summer 2022: Research Assistant**  
  * MBZUAI SAILING LAB ([Link](https://sailing-mbzuai.github.io/))  
  * **Supervisor**: Eric Xing  
  * **Duties**: Worked on theories of standardized machine learning; performed code engineering for an NLP Python package.  

* **Summer 2023: Intern**  
  * BioMap R&D Department  
  * **Supervisor**: Le Song  
  * **Duties**: Developed diffusion models for antibody multi-conformation generation ([Link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=En49NEuCJL)); created a state-of-the-art template-based docking program for antibody-antigen docking.  

* **Summer 2024: Visiting Researcher**  
  * CMU SAILING LAB ([Link](https://sailing-lab.github.io/))  
  * **Supervisor**: Eric Xing  
  * **Duties**: Worked on biological foundation models (AIDO series); developed a protein structure tokenizer, published as first author at NeurIPS 2024 MLSB Workshop ([Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.02.626366v2) [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/genbio-ai/AIDO.Protein2StructureToken-16B)). In this work we trained a 16B structural-informed language model which has the SOTA performance on MSA-free structure prediction.  

* **2024â€“Present: Intern**  
  * GenBio AI ([Link](https://genbio.ai/))
  * **Duties**: Optimizing the structure prediction models with better data pipelines.
